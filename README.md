# Recommendation-System-Project-Group-06

Welcome to the **Recommendation-System-Project-Group-06** repository! 🎉 This project explores the power of recommendation algorithms to help tourists discover the best destinations in the beautiful Toba region, using a dataset rich in tourism-related data. By implementing a mix of **Content-Based Filtering (CBF)**, **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**, and a **Hybrid Model**, this project aims to provide personalized, data-driven recommendations based on user preferences and interactions. 🌍

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this repository, you’ll find three Jupyter Notebook files, each implementing a different recommendation system approach:

### 1. **CBF_Using_KNN_Toba-Tourism_Group-6**  
This notebook implements a **Content-Based Filtering (CBF)** recommendation system using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm. It recommends tourism destinations based on the similarity of features (e.g., location, type, category) to the user’s preferences, providing relevant suggestions based on the user’s past interactions. 🗺️

**Key Concepts:**
- KNN-based content similarity
- Recommendations based on item attributes

### 2. **CF_Using_ALS_Toba-Tourism_Group-6**  
This notebook demonstrates a **Collaborative Filtering (CF)** recommendation system using **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)**. This approach leverages user-item interactions (such as ratings or visits) to recommend destinations that similar users have liked. The ALS algorithm is ideal for matrix factorization tasks, allowing us to predict missing values in a large dataset of user preferences. 🔄

**Key Concepts:**
- Matrix factorization with ALS
- Recommendations based on user-item interactions

### 3. **Hybrid-Model_Toba-Tourism_Group-6**  
This notebook combines the strengths of both **Collaborative Filtering (CF)** and **Content-Based Filtering (CBF)** by using **SVD** (Singular Value Decomposition) for CF and **Cosine Similarity** for CBF. By blending these techniques, the hybrid system offers more accurate and diverse recommendations that take into account both user behavior and the content features of the items. 🤝

**Key Concepts:**
- Hybrid recommendation system (CF + CBF)
- SVD for collaborative filtering and Cosine Similarity for content-based filtering

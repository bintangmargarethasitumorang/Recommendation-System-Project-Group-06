# Recommendation-System-Project-Group-06

Welcome to the **Recommendation-System-Project-Group-06** repository! This project aims to develop a recommendation system for Toba Tourism using various approaches, including Content-Based Filtering (CBF), Collaborative Filtering (CF), and Hybrid methods. The dataset used in this project contains tourism-related data for the Toba region, which helps in recommending destinations based on user preferences and interactions.

## Overview

This repository contains three main Jupyter Notebook files, each implementing a different recommendation algorithm:

1. **CBF_Using_KNN_Toba-Tourism_Group 6**  
   This notebook implements a **Content-Based Filtering (CBF)** recommendation system using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm. The model recommends tourism destinations based on the similarity of their features to the user's preferences.

2. **CF_Using_ALS_Toba-Tourism_Group 6**  
   This notebook demonstrates a **Collaborative Filtering (CF)** recommendation system using **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)**, which factors in user-item interactions to provide recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.

3. **Hybrid-Model_Toba-Tourism_Group 6**  
   This notebook combines **Collaborative Filtering (CF)** (using **SVD**) and **Content-Based Filtering (CBF)** (using **Cosine Similarity**) to build a **Hybrid Recommendation System**. The hybrid approach combines the strengths of both methods to provide better recommendations.
